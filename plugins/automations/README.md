# Automations

Run actions on your hosts on a schedule or when something happens, like a host going down or a metric crossing a limit.

## Features

- Triggers: a schedule, a host going up or down, a metric crossing a limit, a health check change, a container event, a Termix event or an incoming webhook.
- Steps: send an alert, call a URL, run a snippet or command, control a container or tunnel, wake a host, wait, set a variable, branch with if / otherwise, run another automation or stop.
- Run an automation on the host that triggered it or on any host or fleet you pick.
- See the output and errors of each step for every run.
