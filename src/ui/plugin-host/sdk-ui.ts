/**
 * @termix/plugin-sdk/ui: the shell's components, for plugins.
 *
 * Everything exported here is public API. A plugin builds its UI from these
 * so it looks like the rest of the app and picks up theme changes, and it
 * receives the shell's own instances through the import map, never a copy.
 *
 * The list is deliberate. It covers what the bundled plugins use today: the
 * shadcn primitives, the composites for metrics, connection screens and
 * settings rows, and the contexts a connection surface needs. Adding to it is
 * a contract change. Removing from it breaks plugins.
